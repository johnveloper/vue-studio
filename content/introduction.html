<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Over the last 10 years our web pages have become more dynamic and powerful thanks to JavaScript.</p>
<p>We've moved a lot of code that was normally on the server side into our browsers, leaving us with thousands of lines of JavaScript code, connecting to various HTML and CSS files, with no formal organization.</p>
<p>This is why more and more developers are using JavaScript frameworks like Angular, React or Vue.</p>

<h2>What is Vue?</h2>
<p>Vue.js is an approachable, versatile, performant, web framework that helps you create a more maintainable and testable codebase.</p>
<p>Vue is a progressive framework, which means that if you have an existing server-side app, you can plug Vue into just one part of your app that need a richer, more interactive experience.</p>
<p>If you want to build more business logic into your front end from the get go, Vue has the core libraries and the ecosystem (Vue, VueX, Vue-Router) you'll need to scale.</p>
<p>Vue allows you to split your webpage into reusable components, each having its own HTML, CSS and JavaScript code needed to reneder that piece of the page.</p>

<h2>Top 2 GitHub Repository</h2>
<p>As for 8 April 2019, Vue has over 134k start on its GitHub repository, making it top 2 most-starred repository. (Freecodecamp.org is first with 300k+ stars).</p>
<p>It recently surpassed even Bootstrap (128k), React (126k) and any other web framework, and it's growing faster than any of them too.</p>
